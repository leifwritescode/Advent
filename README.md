# Leif's Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to challenges presented in Eric Wastl's _Advent of Code_. Each year, I like to try a completing the challenges in a new-to-me language. For the last two event years, as a result of time constraints, I stuck with C#. I used Go, Swift, and Kotlin in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. I have completeted a variety of challenges from previous years in those languages, too.
