# Advent

This repository contains my solutions to challenges presented in Eric Wastl's _Advent of Code_. Each year, I use a new language to solve the challenges.

Most recently, in 2021, I used Go. In 2020, I used Swift. In my first year of participation, 2019, I used Kotlin. In addition to each years solutions, I have implemented solutions for challenges from several previous years too.

Each language subdirectory contains its own README.md with additional information.
